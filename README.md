ðŸ“° News Headline Classification System
This project implements a real-time news classification system for categorizing headlines into relevant topics using both classical machine learning and deep learning approaches. It features a clean and responsive web interface built using Flask, HTML, and CSS, allowing users to input a news headline and instantly receive predictions.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
Developed a complete end-to-end pipeline that classifies news headlines using both classical ML models (Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression) and deep learning architectures (LSTM and GRU). The system evaluates model performance using accuracy, F1-score, and training time, providing insights into the trade-offs between different modeling techniques.

The frontend is implemented using HTML/CSS and served through Flask, offering a user-friendly interface for real-time headline prediction.

In the process, I gained strong experience in:

Text preprocessing and tokenization

Word embeddings and sequence modeling

Comparative evaluation of ML/DL models

Flask web application development

Frontend styling with HTML and CSS

ðŸš€ Features
